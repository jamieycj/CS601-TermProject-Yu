# CS601-TermProject-Yu

Welcome to my project. This project is to set up a website about my biography and to introduce the three babies in my house featuring their daily life and growth milestones. The project is also aimed to show all the front-end techniques I have learned during CS601 of MS in Software Development at Boston University.

## Week 3 Progress

This assignment is a standalone task apart from the term project. The workplace is a simple web-based calculator powered mainly by Javascript for user interaction and basic functions. In addition, HTML and CSS are used to enable the work result and styling. 

<em>The following Javascript operaters are used</em>
```
>, ===, +, =, ++, 
```

<em>The following Javascript data types are used</em>
```
Boolean (isNaN, isOk), Number, String
```

<em>The following Javascript methods are used</em>
```
prompt(), alert(), confirm(), function(), parseInt(), trim()
```

<strong>The following Javascript features are used for extra credits:</strong>
- `ternary operator`: ? and :
- `DOM manipulation`: getElementsbyId, appendChild, createTextNode, createElement
- `Validate the numbers input`: isNaN
- `Validate the names input`: userName.length != 0
- `Use onclick event for a buttion`: <button>Start Program</button>
- `Style the page with CSS`: ./Calculator.css
<br><br><br>

## Week 4 Progress
The assignment of Week 4 is a standalone input form with validation powered by HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

<strong>The following required features are included:</strong>
- `Name inputs with validation`: firstName, lastName and facilitator
- `Radio button`
- `Checkbox`
- `Page style with CSS`: ./form.css
- `POST` the inputs to designated database with successful notice

<strong>The following are used for extra credits:</strong>
- Style error messages
- Use DOM to write error messages
- Use <button>Reset</button> to clear inputs
<br><br><br>


## Week 5 Progress
The assignment of Week 5 consists of 2 part: Part is to create a JSON document to include my academic background. Part 2 is to use fetch API to get the data of the JSON document, put it on a webpage and host it. This is a standalone application. 

<strong>The following required features are included:</strong> 
- Create, validate and upload the **degrees.JSON** file to a web server: [Glitch](https://cs601-hw5-yu.glitch.me/degrees.json)
- Create **degrees.JS** to make a fetch API call, resolve the promise, check the response status, process the data in **degrees.JSON** by using table approach
- Host the website at: [Glitch](https://cs601-hw5-yu.glitch.me/degrees.html)

<strong>The following are used for extra credits:</strong>
- `Use a click button to make the fetch API call`
- `Style with CSS`: ./degrees.css
- `Use DOM to avoid duplicate loading`: if the same fetch API is called more than once, only one set of data will be shown
<br><br><br>

## Week 6 Progress
The assignment of week 6 is to create a gallery using Vue.js framework. This assignment will also be included in the term project to reflect the Vue.js learned. 

<strong>The following features are included:</strong>
- Create the application using Vue CLI
- Create four sets of images as an array in data section
- Create mouseover and mouseout effect for image changing

<br><br><br>

# Project Status
This is an ongoing project to be completed by phases. Phase 1 includes HTML semantic elements and phase 2 includes CSS. 
<br><br>
The work of phase 3-6 are standalone applications, however, similar techniques learned from those applications have been applied to term project. 
<br><br>
